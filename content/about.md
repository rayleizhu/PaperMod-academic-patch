Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

To customize your homepage:

1. Edit your personal information including your affiliation, position, email, experience, awards, social links, and possibly more in the `config.yml` file under your site root.
2. Put your publications in the `content/pubs`, each publication is created as a separate markdown file with the publication information.
3. Update your latest news in the `content/news` folder. Again, each news item is created as a separate markdown file.
